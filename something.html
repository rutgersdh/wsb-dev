            </div>         
         
         
         <p>The first week of duty is finishing, and in looking back I cannot find a single thing
            which was not more agreeable than was expected. First, we all had to go to the doctor's
            and receive two vaccinations, and an injection of antitoxin in the left breast; consequently
            my arm has a horrible sore on it (it took), and for two days my chest and left arm
            were very sore.</p>
         
         <p>Tuesday our regular day started. We arise at 5.15, line up for reveille at 5.30, breakfast
            at 5.50, and drill from 6.50 until 12, or when we 'mess'. Then we drill from 1.50
            until 4.00, ending with an hour's hike until 5.00. We take a shower in ice water (no
            hot water), have supper at 5.05, and study from 6.30 until 9.30. Lights are out at
            9.45. In off moments we make our beds, bathe, take care of our uniform, and learn
            signalling and orders - all very interesting. Yesterday and to-day (Sunday) I have
            been walking guard duty (two hours walking, two hours relief, and two hours walking).
            I am writing this during relief.</p>
         
         <p>There is a wonderful crowd of men here, mostly college men and Southerners. <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="" title="Ackerman, David Greenlie&#xD;(1895-1968)&#xD;2nd Lieutenant, Field Artillery">Dave Ackerman</a> and <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="" title="Blue, Harry Newton&#xD;(1893-1925)&#xD;1st Lieutenant, Field Artillery">Harry Blue</a> are in my company (Company 1). We sleep in double-deckers. The fellow I share mine
            with is a Harvard man named Cox, assistant secretary of the Guarantee Trust Company,
            and a fine chap. Alongside of me is a Princeton man named Biddle, also a dandy fellow.
            All considered, they could not have picked a finer bunch of men.</p>
         
         <p>Now about the food! A sample day runs like this. Breakfast: Oatmeal, scrambled eggs,
            fried potatoes, coffee, bread, milk, etc. Dinner: Roast Beef, mashed potatoes, and
            gravy, spinach, side vegetables, bread pudding, coffee or tea. Supper: French toast,
            stewed tomatoes, jam, salad, fruit or pudding, coffee.</p>
         
         <h4>Page: 2</h4><br />
         
         <p>On Sunday we get a good roast of veal and ice cream. So, you see, the 'eats' are fine,
            and we get absolutely all we want of them. The cook is a regular army man, and we
            have half a dozen uniformed 'serving men' in each company. The days are as hot as
            blazes, but the nights are cool. In fact, last week I sometimes slept with two army
            blankets and a bathrobe over me.</p>

         <p>I received your letter and am glad to hear that you and "friend" are at the shore.
            It
            will do you both lots of good. Thank "friend" for the postal. It is very nice that
            you have a chance to get a commission but hold off and stay where you are. There are
            plenty to do the work.</p>
         
         <p>I had to run out just then and take a look at an aeroplane passing over the barracks
            - a big flying boat affair only about 500 feet up.</p>
         
         <h4>Page: 4</h4><br />
         
         <p>We see all kinds of interesting sights every day - new flying machine, search lights,
            boats and men of war.</p>
         
         <p>The work continues just about the same. We plug on geometry, trig, and physics; play
            war games, drill on the guns, attend lectures, <i>snatch [?]</i> half an
            hours swim and wait for Sunday and rest to come.</p>
         
         <p>The hard thing is not being able to see home or any of you there. There is not the
            excitement of <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=38_52_54_N_77_4_58_W" title="Fort Myer, VA">Fort
               Myer</a> here and that is what makes things go harder. The kind of work we
            have to me however more than compensates for the grind.</p>
         
         <p> If we go to France it will </p>
         
         <h4>Page: 5</h4><br />
         
         <p>be with heavy field and seige guns. Some of us will probably be there by
            fall. Don't tell anyone about that however. It would scare my aunt to death. She
            thinks that none of us will ever leave the country.</p>
         
         <p>Give my best to the "gang" Tell <i>Dave [?]</i> that I will write him soon
            but not to wait for me to do that little thing.</p>

         <p>Everything is going very 
            <h4>Page: 7</h4><br /> smoothly.</p>
         
         <p>Last evening a <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">german submarine<span class="top">German U-boats frequently visited the Eastern shores of the United States to

             was reported in the bay. A

            They also had the <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">submarine net<span class="top">The German submarine fleet spurred the creation of new forms of defense,

            boats nothing happened. I have not heard yet whether they captured anything. The
            first taste of war.</p>
         
         <h4>Page: 8</h4><br />
         
         <p>We finished our work on the big guns and are starting on the smaller ones which is
            much less exciting but necessary nevertheless.</p>
         
         <p>I have had a couple of good suppers at <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">the Chamberlin<span class="top">The Chamberlin Hotel, on the property of Fort

            One astronomical instrument built like a sextant, very old and probably an antique
            but
            probably of some service; a book which was written in 1662 (or published at that
            time) about science in general and a reference in it about communication by magnetic
            attraction which is quite singular. </p>

            he entered the service that he has neglected us and we did not have a chance,

            Somewhere in France. <br />June 7, 1918.
            </div>
         
         <div style="text-align: left;">Dear Reed:</div>
         
         
         <p>At last I am <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">"over here"<span class="top">Ainsworth was likely in Libourne here.</span></a> and everything is so peaceful in the locality where I am
            situated that it hardly seems I am in a country which has been at war for four years.
            Of course I am in a place very many miles from the firing line which accounts for
            the
            tranquility. You must understand, while I censor my own mail, that I cannot reveal
            many things and must deal largely in generalities in writing you. </p>
         
         <h4>Page: 18</h4><br />
         
         <p>
            [2] ( First of all I want to enquire for
            "friend-wife" and "Mike" I hope both are as well as ever and suppose "Mike" is
            growing everyday. Tickle him for me. ) </p>
         
         <p>The trip over was wonderful. The sea was very calm and the weather beautiful all the
            way over except for about two days when it blew up rather rough and as the seas
            caught us sideways the boat rocked to beat the band. It sometimes rocked so that for
            hours if you were sitting on deck you were looking alternatively at the sky above
            and
            the water beneath you and unless you braced your steamer chair you would slide, chair
            and all across the deck. Many of the men were dreadfully seasick but it did not
            effect me in the least, in fact I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
         
         <p>I have often heard what 
            <h4>Page: 19</h4><br />
            [3] a wonderful sight land is after days at sea but never
            realized it until I saw it at the end of our voyage.</p>
         
         <p> Of our debarking and train trip I may say little except that the scenery was
            wonderful but in a different way from America. Our beautiful sections as a rule are
            the wild ones but the beautiful sections of France are often the cultivated ones.</p>
         
         <p>At present our company is billetted in an old French estate surrounded by vineyards.
            The officers live in the chateau which is a great white stone house with a tile roof
            (one of the originals from which the millionnaires take their plans for their seaside
            homes)</p>
         
         <p>I have a nice big room with an adjoining second floor parlour. In back there is a
            terrace with a 
            <h4>Page: 20</h4><br /> palm and rose garden containing a wonderful pagoda. A
            brook with a deep swimming hole runs thru a nearby meadow and affords the
            men an opportunity for bathing. The days are very warm and the nights cool.</p>
         
         <p>What more could one ask for?</p>
         
         <p>I am very well and very happy and, I believe, very fortunate.</p>
         
         <p>I will write in the near future and want you to do that little thing very often.</p>

         <p> I have received several of the College Letters but as yet no real letters from
            yourself telling me all of the latest gossip. What is the matter? I know that it must
            be several weeks since I last wrote you but time goes so fast over here that it seems
            but yesterday. For five weeks none of us received a letter from the U.S.; when they
            finally arrived however they came in a bunch and we had to knock-off for about two
            days to read them all. </p>
         
         <p> Some time ago I was in a large city near here and who should I meet in the Y.M.C.A.
            but <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="" title="Ludlow, Charles&#xD;(1895-19--)&#xD;Seaman, Navy">Chip Ludlow</a> all decked out in his naval uniform and looking
            very snappy. I made an appointment and dined with him the next day. It was awfully
            good to see him and get all of the home news first hand. I have not had the chance
            to
            get to <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">Base Hospital #8<span class="top">According to Joe Costa, there were at least 8 Rutgers men stationed at Base

         <p> We are still located in the same place, living comfortably and working like the
            devil. Of my work I can say little as I have little time to spend in gadding around
            my letters are bound to be very uninteresting. The war news of the past few weeks
            has
            been very good as you of course know. I have talked with men who have been "in" the
            big drive and some of their stories and are wonderful. I wish I could tell them all.
            I may have a few of my own some day. I have seen many german prisoners. Nearly all
            of
            them strapping men and well set-up but with the face of a machine unlike the
            Americans or French. Some have long beards a foot long. </p>

         <p>I have been neglecting you for the past two or three weeks, but we have all been so
            busy trying to make Rutgers a war college that there has been absolutely no time for
            anything else, except the immediate work which we are trying to do. Even now there
            is
            only the chance for this brief note.</p>
         
         <p>Things have changed so much here that you would hardly recognize the place. The
            college is now on a <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">distinct war footing<span class="top">The October 3, 1918 edition of The Targum discusses the cessation of fraternity
                  activities and the ceding of campus spaces to the War Department and the
                  Student Army Training Corps (SATC).</span></a>, with mess in Winants Hall, all the men quartered in the two dormitories and the
            three fraternity houses, and no one being permitted to leave the campus without a
            pass. The Delt house is one of those which has been taken over as a barracks, and
            there are now 42 men at <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">77 Hamilton Street<span class="top">This building has since become the office of the dean of the School of Arts and
                  Sciences.</span></a>
            ; only three of them Delts. Fraternity initiations have been forbidden and no
            fraternity meetings may be held, so it looks very much as if the chapters will have
            rather hard sledding. There are now 10 Delts in College, Jimmy Losee, LeCraw, L. Sherwin,
            Bob Farley, Newall Chase, Carleton Jones, and four freshmen you do not know. We are
            hoping that enough men will be left when things are adjusted, to start the chapter
            organization again. </p>

         <p> What was my surprise to receive a couple of letters from you the last few days. I
            was glad to see that you had a few good days at the seashore with the <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/LCRM-W14" title="Terrill, Edith Irona&#xD;(1893-1966)&#xD;Spouse of Earl Reed Silvers">wife</a>
            and son. Has "friend" taught the kid to swim yet? I have been less fortunate in not
            having had a swim this year. I expect however in the future sometime to more than
            make up for the lost time. </p>
         
         <p> According to your letters 
            <h4>Page: 25</h4><br />
            (2) the changes at College must be very radical. I am sorry
            on account of the fraternity but otherwise the new routine must be very interesting.
            </p>
         
         <p> Since the last writing I have been doing the usual moving around from place to place
            tring to keep up with a very active war. Yesterday I went thru what had
            been no-man's land a few days before but is now ours. I had lunch in an old
            bocch "pillbox" which was heated by a "bocch" <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">"Feld

            church indicate where the village used to be. Shell holes filled with green water,
            rusty barbed wire, shells, trenches all tell of the long struggle. In places entire

         <div style="text-align: left;">Dear Reed:</div>
         
         
         <p> I have not heard from you in a long time but presume that things are going smoothly
            as usual. How was the news of peace, the abdication of the Kaiser Etc received in
            the
            States. I'll bet there was some <i>demonstration [?]</i> particularly by
            those about to be drafted. Please 
            <h4>Page: 29</h4><br />

            </p>
         
         <p> We are just sitting tight at present awaiting orders. We may be sent to Germany on
            occupation work or home. I am hoping for the latter. </p>
         
         <p> Let me say that it was a great relief to the news when peace was announced. We had
            been under shell fire for weeks and it seemed 
            <h4>Page: 30</h4><br />
            (3) strange to be able to walk about without a tin hat or
            gas mask, not to dodge shells at the cross roads or to drive
            at night without the lights off.</p>
         
         <p>I am up on the last front living in the priest's home in a village which the Huns
            did
            not have time to destroy. It seems strange not to live in a dug-out a in a ruined
            village; to have lights without shades but it is very agreeable needless to say. </p>
         
         <p> Jamey Taylor, lucky dog, received news of peace, received a captaining and was
            ordered home

            </div>
         
         <div style="text-align: left;">Dear Father:</div>
         
         
         <p> I am writing my Christmas letter with the hopes that I may be home by that time
            myself to tell you about things myself. Probably the best thing I can do is simply
            to
            give you a brief outline of our stay in France. The <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">censorship
               rules<span class="top">Prior to the armistice, it would have been important to omit location and troop
                  information.</span></a>
             have been so altered that this is not only
            possible but invited. </p>
         
         <p> First, let me start with out trip across. We went over with one of the biggest
            convoys leaving the States. Fourteen transports in all. Our ship was the <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">converted Dutch ship "Ryndam"<span class="top"> The Rijndam, previously a passenger liner, was placed in commission by the
                  U.S. Navy in March 1918. </span></a> and we made the first run she made as a transport. I may also state that it
            was the first ship taken by our Government to make a trip over without a single
            break-down. As you may well imagine, I spent some time in the engine-room. </p>
         
         <p>We arrived in <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=48_23__N_4_29__W" title="Brest, France">
               "Brest"</a> on May 23 and marched to the famous barracks <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">(Pentamasian Barracks)<span class="top">Napoleon Bonaparte held Black political prisoners originating from the

             used by Napoleon where we stayed for one day leaving the next for "<del>D</del>Libourne" which is close to Bordeaux and
            in the heart of wine country. We stayed at <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=44_55__N_0_14__W" title="Libourne, France">Libourne</a> for two months where we received
            our training and equipment. The guns we received were the <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">French
               155 G.P.F.<span class="top">The 155 mm Grande Puissance Filloux (GPF), a long-range heavy artillery cannon,
                  could reach a target within 16 kilometers or about 10 miles.</span></a>
             which is equivalent to our six inch gun. It is very mobile, powerful rifle
            and probably the most famous gun of the war. These with <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">American

            , trucks, touring cars and motorcycles constituted our equipment. It was quite
            a sight to see our outfit on the road- miles of trucks and guns. </p>
         
         <p> After receiving our equipment we went to <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=44_51_50_N_0_51_40_W" title="Camp de Souge, France">Camp
               de Souge</a> which is South of Bordeaux where we held target practice for
            two weeks. It was here that I made a balloon ascension and here also 
            <h4>Page: 33</h4><br />

            that the car I was riding in was hit by shrapnel out on the range. Some boob made a mistake of 90 degrees in deflection and nearly
            landed the shell in our <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">tonneau<span class="top">The rear body of the car.</span></a>.</p>
         
         <p>One day we received hurry up orders to leave for the front. It took five teams to
            get
            our regiment up. We got off, after a three day ride and received orders to get into
            <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">action immediately at the tip of St. Mehile salient<span class="top">As an officer with the 57th Coast Artillery Corps, Ainsworth would have participated
                  in the St. Mihiel, and Meuse-Argonne Operations in support of 1st U.S. Army in France
                  until the Armistice</span></a>. You never saw such a
            hurry in your life. It so happened that one of our battalions (the first to arrive)
            after working like dogs got into position only to learn that the infantry had gone
            clear beyond their range. They never fired a shot in that battle. Before leaving
            Libourne we had lost one battalion to railway artillery and had given another that
            was already at the front. The latter was in the <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=48_53_21_N_05_32_37_E" title="Saint-Mihiel, France"> St.
               Mehile</a> battle and did very good work. </p>
         
         <p>After that job was done we proceeded to the historic field before Verdun. Here we
            started our party. We had, in the Argonne Offensive, as you have probably read, the
            hardest job any army ever had. I was in it from beginning to end. The "bosche"
            divisions were in front of us so thick that it was nearly impossible to write all
            of
            their numbers on the map. The country was hilly and wooded and most difficult and
            costly to fight over. It was during this fight that I took over the Headquarters
            Company. In the middle of this fight while we were at Eppinonville (West of
            Montfaucon) that we received a new Colonel who certainly was a fire-eater.</p>
         
         <p>One of his first actions was to move us nearly into the front line trenches at
            <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">Romogne<span class="top">Romagne-sous-Montfaucon, Meuse</span></a>. One afternoon I started with my company in ten big trucks for our new
            location. Our road led us across a field in full view of the "bosche" who were about
            a mile distant. Right in the middle of the field the first truck dropped 
            <h4>Page: 34</h4><br />
            -3-
            into a shell hole. It took three quarters of an hour to get it out and have never
            been able to figure out why fire was not opened up on us. As it was they did not
            start until we were off of the road. </p>
         
         <p>In our new location we lived in a little cabin about 1 1/2 kilometers (1 mile) from
            the "bosche" for six days. We were shelled all of the time and gassed part of the
            time especially at night. Officers and men were killed. My company lost quite
            heavily. I had trucks and cars hit. Often at night shell fragments and dirt hit our
            cabin and we slept with our masks handy.</p>
         
         <p>There was one place in full view of our house where the "bosche" liked to shell and
            in the evenings we used to sit on the porch, hear the shells come over the hill,
            whistle over our heads and see them crash down the valley. It was very
            entertaining.</p>
         
         <p>But when the drive of November 1st started things changed considerably. I shall never
            forget the barrage our guns let loose that night. I sat in a dug-out we had
            constructed under the floor of our cabin with a phone glued to my ear keeping in
            touch with the battalions and our brigade and otherwise trying to run the operations
            of the regiment.</p>
         
         <p>The sky was just one glare of lights. We had a gun under every bush and when they
            let
            loose you would think that all Hell had popped. Fritz suddenly started to leave the
            territory and he never stopped. I don't blame him a bit for the business end of our
            fire must have been hell itself.</p>
         
         <p>That was the last big party. We followed Fritz to the place I am at present, near
            Stenay on the Meuse. When we got here the armistice was signed and we are just
            sitting tight awaiting developments.</p>
         
         <h4>Page: 35</h4><br />
         
         <p>-4- We may be sent to Germany or go home. We are ready and willing for either. </p>
         
         <p> I have not attempted to give you any detail of experiences. Doubtless you get some
            from my previous letters. This is just a general outline to let you have some idea
            of
            where I have been and what I have been doing. The rest will be told when I see you.
            </p>
         
         <p> I am in excellent health and getting on O.K. </p>

         <p>I have written no one for the last month. The reason is that I expected to be home
            before a letter could up to two weeks ago and since then I have been on the train
            most of the time <del>since</del>. To make up for lost time, let
            me begin a month back. </p>
         
         <p>Our regiment made a long run about 125 miles from the front to the little town of
            <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=48_22_41_N_4_55_23_E" title="Doulevant-le-Chateau, France">Doulevant</a> about a week after the signing of the armistice. It does
            not sound far but for a train of trucks, many 
            <h4>Page: 43</h4><br /> 2in poor shape after months
            of service at the front, and tractors which were equally used up and dragging our
            155's it was a long grind. I lived in the chateau of the Duke at Doulevant for about
            two weeks while we refitted the men and made preparations to return to the U.S. Dec.
            15th we entrained near Doulevant and left for <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=48_23__N_4_29__W" title="Brest, France">Brest</a>, arriving there Dec. 18th at
            night in a cold rainstorm such as one only finds in Brittany. On the 21st all regular
            officers, except the Colonel, were notified that they would remain in France and to
            proceed to a town south of Bordeaux, <a style="color:red;text-decoration:none;" class="btn btn-primary tooltip">Le Courneau<span class="top">The French turned over Le Courneau (Camp Hunt) to the Americans as an artillery

            immediately to <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=48_51_24_N_2_21_08_E" title="Paris, France">Paris</a> where 
            <h4>Page: 44</h4><br /> 3we spent Christmas, staying for four days
            afterwards as well. I enjoyed Paris more then any other city I was ever in. I visited
            Notre Dame, Napoleon's Tomb and the more popular shows and cafes. It was certainly
            necessary to watch your step in this town. The women all talk English and do
            everything but kidnap one. They not only stop one on the street and invite one to
            spend the night with them but are inclined to argue if you talk to them at all on
            the
            subject. It is nothing to be approached half a dozen times on a block. From Paris
            we
            went to Bordeaux and, the next day, to Le Courneau. </p>
         
         <p> Le Courneau is an enormous camp of casual officers and men and there was nothing
            to
            do at all. Fortunately 
            <h4>Page: 45</h4><br /> (4)we were only there a day when we were ordered to

            detrained when we first arrived on the front. Here we proceeded, via Paris, and

                  particular unit. This practice was discontinued after WWII because men assigned to
                  replacement depots developed low morale and were unfamiliar with the fighting formations
                  of the units to which they were eventually assigned.</span></a>

         <p>How did you enjoy Christmas? I didn't enjoy it at all being at Paris and living in
            a
            hotel which is the last place to be on Christmas. How did Mike make out?</p>
         
         <p>I certainly wished that I could have been with you all, and expected to for a while,
            but am hoping now for next Christmas.</p>

         <p>
            Yesterday I returned from my first leave at <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=43_42_12_N_7_15_59_E" title="Nice, France">Nice</a> and found awaiting me a huge bundle of mail, including some from you, which had been
            sent all over France to my various addresses and finally caught up. I cannot realize
            how big "Mike" must be to walk &amp; talk. The last time I saw him he was such a little
            fellow. I am afraid he wont recognize me at all.
            
            <h4>Page: 49</h4><br />
            Congratulations on the new home. I certainly hope you will enjoy it.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            I have just finished the most wonderful two weeks I have ever put in. I just went
            to <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=43_17_47_N_5_22_12_E" title="Marseille, France">Marseille</a> where I spent one day and then on to <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=43_42_12_N_7_15_59_E" title="Nice, France">Nice</a> where I spent eight days on the shore of the Mediterranean in climate such as we
            have at Florida in the winter. All I did was sleep, eat, automobile, dance and play
            tennis. The county is simply wonderful. Huge palm trees, the almond trees in bloom,
            the orange trees covered covered with fruit, the olive trees green like the grass.
            All of this
            
            <h4>Page: 50</h4><br />
            foliage with the sea a dark blue green and the snow clad Alps in the distance made
            a picture I will never forget. I certainly will come back to it some day. I went to
            <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=43_43_59_N_7_25_0_E" title="Monaco">Monaco</a>, <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=43_44_23_N_7_25_38_E" title="Monte Carlo, Monaco">Monte Carlo</a> and over the Italian border as far as they would let me. I met some wonderful French
            and Italian girls who danced and played tennis wonderfully so you can well imagine
            I managed to have a good time. On the way back I went up through the <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=45_49_58_N_6_51_54_E" title="French Alps">French Alps</a> and never expect to see such scenery again as long as I live. We went up to
            
            <h4>Page: 51</h4><br />
            snow but it was so clear and dry that it did not feel cold in the least.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            I am back now, however, to the land of rain and mud with a coat of tan entirely out
            of place and in wonderful condition to go back on the job.
